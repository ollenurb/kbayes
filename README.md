# Killer Bayes
A simple implementation of a Bayesian spam filter. This project has been created for educational purposes to teach myself some principles behind probabilistic machine learning models such as Naive Bayes. For such reasons it hasn't been designed to be used in production.

## Build
There are essentially 2 methods that I reccomend to build the program:
1. Install `cabal` using any package manager of your choice, then run `cabal build` inside the project's root directory
2. Install `nix`, then run `nix-build` to generate the executable
